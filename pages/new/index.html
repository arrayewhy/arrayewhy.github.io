			<b>We are physical manifestations of ideas.</b><br>
			<br>
			If you do not know what you want, and do not serve someone else's want, you cannot participate in the economy of ideas.<br>
			<br>
			To directly benefit from the economy of ideas, is to manifest ideas, either your own or someone else's.

			<b>Multiple points of information trump a single high-resolution data point.</b><br>
			<br>
			A single high-resolution data point is fine if one is able to perceive the gradations in the data point, especially after heavy compression.<br>
			<br>
			Similar to how a high-resolution image can be compressed an shrunk to a comparatively small size, whilst retaining a discernable level of detail.<br>
			<br>
			But take away that <span class="red-text">perception of gradation</span>, eg. through blurriness or colour-blindness, and you will be left with a single ambiguous data point.<br>
			<br>
			However, say we separate this data point at points where these gradations intersect into multiple data points.<br>
			<br>
			The resulting fragments could hold meaning inferred through their shared relationship.<br>
			<br>
			The possibility of deducing the information held in the original gradations is not completely lost, even with the loss of the previously mentioned <span class="red-text">perception</span>.

			<b>Art</b> is a sentient response to the perception of reality.<br>
			<br>
			In that a sentient being can act in both consciousness and unconsciousness.
			The dance is not about us. We find that we <i>want</i> to dance, and find ourselves dancing.
			In a world where simpler forms of consciousness dance in entropy, heat, and stone,
			Others dance in the orbit of stars, and planets.
			Some seemingly going in circles, while others struggling to stay in place.

			<b>A name is more than a reference.</b><br>
			<br>
			The reference used to call for a specific point of data can be anything. It can be replaced with any alphanumeric value without affecting the data whatsoever. A person's given name, however, may not be replaced without altering the very personality it is used to call for. In this way, the giving of a name is a sort of prayer for the manifestation of a certain trait or character.
