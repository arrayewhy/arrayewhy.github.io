			<h2>William Shatner in Space</h2>

			<p>
				“We got out of our harnesses and began to float around. The other folks went straight
				into somersaults and enjoying all the effects of weightlessness. I wanted no part in
				that. I wanted, needed to get to the window as quickly as possible to see what was out
				there.
				<br /><br />
				I looked down and I could see the hole that our spaceship had punched in the thin,
				blue-tinged layer of oxygen around Earth. It was as if there was a wake trailing behind
				where we had just been, and just as soon as I’d noticed it, it disappeared.
				<br /><br />
				I continued my self-guided tour and turned my head to face the other direction, to stare
				into space. I love the mystery of the universe. I love all the questions that have come
				to us over thousands of years of exploration and hypotheses… all of that has thrilled me
				for years… but when I looked in the opposite direction, into space, there was no
				mystery, no majestic awe to behold… all I saw was death.
				<br /><br />
				I saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on
				Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. I turned back toward the light of
				home. I could see the curvature of Earth, the beige of the desert, the white of the
				clouds and the blue of the sky. It was life. Nurturing, sustaining, life. Mother Earth.
				Gaia. And I was leaving her.
				<br /><br />
				Everything I had thought was wrong. Everything I had expected to see was wrong.
				<br /><br />
				I had thought that going into space would be the ultimate catharsis of that connection I
				had been looking for between all living things—that being up there would be the next
				beautiful step to understanding the harmony of the universe. In the film “Contact,” when
				Jodie Foster’s character goes to space and looks out into the heavens, she lets out an
				astonished whisper, “They should’ve sent a poet.” I had a different experience, because
				I discovered that the beauty isn’t out there, it’s down here, with all of us. Leaving
				that behind made my connection to our tiny planet even more profound.
				<br /><br />
				It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast
				between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me
				with overwhelming sadness. ... My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration;
				instead, it felt like a funeral.”
				<br /><br />
				- William Shatner

			<h2>Evolution of the Ability to Comprehend</h2>

			<p>
				For things it has seen before, 'cells' in its brain would fire in ways that feel
				familiar.
				<br /><br />
				If it were to see something for the first time, however, parts in the brain responsible
				for 'meaning' would act in ways it is not accustomed to, possibly leading to new
				sensations.
				<br /><br />
				Now, if its brain were to somehow be unable to 'hold' the meaning of this vision, would
				it adapt? Or would evolution through another mutation be necessary for the 'handling' of
				said meaning?

			<h2>Replacing dopamine with valued progress.</h2>

			<p>The next time you find yourself procrastinating, do the following:</p>

			<p><b>1. Think of the task you are avoiding.</b></p>
			<p>Imagine the probable effects of that task, repeating until you see clearly see how the task
				brings about a result you desire.</p>

			<p>This does, however, require that you have genuine desire for the final outcome.<br>
				Some things we avoid tend to be big and overly complex, and require breaking down into
				manageable tasks.</p>

			<p>This step should give you a tiny spark of motivation, but might not result in you acting.</p>

			<p><b>2. Put away all sources of dopamine.</b></p>
			<p>If you are a dopamine addict, this is when you experience withdrawal. Bear in mind that you
				will not feel good.</p>

			<p>The key to this part lies in remembering that it is not supposed to feel good, as withdrawal
				rarely does.</p>

			<p><b>3. Calling to mind the task, and the outcome that you desire, make progress with the
					task.</b></p>
			<p>Go ahead and break the task into as many steps as you wish, but remember that you will feel
				like running away. Your body is wants to run away, and knows that dopamine is nearby.
				Let the noise happen as you proceed with the task, and when it is completed, consciously
				acknowledge the net good it brings.</p>

			<p>Notice how your body is now calmer, and the craving for dopamine has lost its edge. This is
				why it is paramount that we genuinely wish for the outcome that lies on the other side
				of the task.</p>

			<h2>We are physical manifestations of ideas.</h2>

			<p>
				If you do not know what you want, and do not serve someone else's want, you cannot
				participate in the economy of ideas.
				<br>
				To directly benefit from the economy of ideas, is to manifest ideas, either your own or

			<h2>Multiple points of information trump a single high-resolution data point.</h2>

			<p>
				A single high-resolution data point is fine if one is able to perceive the gradations in
				the data point, especially after heavy compression.
				<br>
				Similar to how a high-resolution image can be compressed an shrunk to a comparatively
				small size, whilst retaining a discernable level of detail.
				<br>
				But take away that <span class="red-text">perception of gradation</span>, eg. through
				blurriness or colour-blindness, and you will be left with a single ambiguous data point.
				<br>
				However, say we separate this data point at points where these gradations intersect into
				multiple data points.
				<br>
				The resulting fragments could hold meaning inferred through their shared relationship.
				<br>
				The possibility of deducing the information held in the original gradations is not
				completely lost, even with the loss of the previously mentioned <span
					class="red-text">perception</span>.

				Art is a sentient response to the perception of reality.

			<p>
				In that a sentient being can act in both consciousness and unconsciousness.

				dancing.
				In a world where simpler forms of consciousness dance in entropy, heat, and stone,

			<h2>
				A name is more than a reference.
			</h2>

			<p>
				The reference used to call for a specific point of data can be anything. It can be
				replaced with any alphanumeric value without affecting the data whatsoever. A person's
				given name, however, may not be replaced without altering the very personality it is
				used to call for. In this way, the giving of a name is a sort of prayer for the
				manifestation of a certain trait or character.
