			<h2>Replacing dopamine with valued progress.</h2>

			<p>The next time you find yourself procrastinating, do the following:</p>

			<p><b>1. Think of the task you are avoiding.</b></p>
			<p>Imagine the probable effects of that task, repeating until you see clearly see how the task brings about a result you desire.</p>

			<p>This does, however, require that you have genuine desire for the final outcome.<br>
			Some things we avoid tend to be big and overly complex, and require breaking down into manageable tasks.</p>

			<p>This step should give you a tiny spark of motivation, but might not result in you acting.</p>

			<p><b>2. Put away all sources of dopamine.</b></p>
			<p>If you are a dopamine addict, this is when you experience withdrawal. Bear in mind that you will not feel good.</p>

			<p>The key to this part lies in remembering that it is not supposed to feel good, as withdrawal rarely does.</p>

			<p><b>3. Calling to mind the task, and the outcome that you desire, make progress with the task.</b></p>
			<p>Go ahead and break the task into as many steps as you wish, but remember that you will feel like running away. Your body is wants to run away, and knows that dopamine is nearby. Let the noise happen as you proceed with the task, and when it is completed, consciously acknowledge the net good it brings.</p>

			<p>Notice how your body is now calmer, and the craving for dopamine has lost its edge. This is why it is paramount that we genuinely wish for the outcome that lies on the other side of the task.</p>

			<h2>We are physical manifestations of ideas.</h2>

			<p>
				If you do not know what you want, and do not serve someone else's want, you cannot participate in the economy of ideas.
				<br>
				To directly benefit from the economy of ideas, is to manifest ideas, either your own or someone else's.

			<h2>Multiple points of information trump a single high-resolution data point.</h2>

			<p>
				A single high-resolution data point is fine if one is able to perceive the gradations in the data point, especially after heavy compression.
				<br>
				Similar to how a high-resolution image can be compressed an shrunk to a comparatively small size, whilst retaining a discernable level of detail.
				<br>
				But take away that <span class="red-text">perception of gradation</span>, eg. through blurriness or colour-blindness, and you will be left with a single ambiguous data point.
				<br>
				However, say we separate this data point at points where these gradations intersect into multiple data points.
				<br>
				The resulting fragments could hold meaning inferred through their shared relationship.
				<br>
				The possibility of deducing the information held in the original gradations is not completely lost, even with the loss of the previously mentioned <span class="red-text">perception</span>.

				Art is a sentient response to the perception of reality.
			</h2>

			<p>
				In that a sentient being can act in both consciousness and unconsciousness.
				The dance is not about us. We find that we <i>want</i> to dance, and find ourselves dancing.
				In a world where simpler forms of consciousness dance in entropy, heat, and stone,

				Others dance in the orbit of stars, and planets.
				Some seemingly going in circles, while others struggle to stay in place.

			<h2>
				A name is more than a reference.
			</h2>

			<p>
				The reference used to call for a specific point of data can be anything. It can be replaced with any alphanumeric value without affecting the data whatsoever. A person's given name, however, may not be replaced without altering the very personality it is used to call for. In this way, the giving of a name is a sort of prayer for the manifestation of a certain trait or character.
